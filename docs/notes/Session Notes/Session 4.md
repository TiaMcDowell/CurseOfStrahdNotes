Character question: What's your home like
The Three-Gees: All live in a small hobbit-esque home (lots of hunching for Ghogmah)
Heiro: Considers the cathedral his home (Notre-Dame?)
Tuesday: Considers the forest his home, (basically a disney princess)

pt. 1

The death house continued
Finished off the fight with the zombies, won without casualties.
Found treasure: 
 -silvered shortsword, 
 -25gp, 11sp
 -carmelian black eyepatch
 -3 moss agate wrapped in black cloth
Also, exploration revealed a painting/statue of [[Strahd]]
Heard chanting from deeper down("One must die" and "he is the ancient/land")
investigated chanted
Investigation revealed a very angry large plant. (shambling mound)
-------
The death house escape:
Ran away from shambling mound
house turned back to normal, where the doors are replaced with saws and 
breaking walls turns them into rats
Party escaped, Three-Gees climbed out of window with rope
[[Heiro]] and [[Tuesday]] braved the saws and left throught the front door. 
In hindsight, should have just jumped out the window 
 -(3d6 bludgeoning damage isn't the worst)
Found gift basket outside.

pt. 2
-------- 
Welcome to Baroiva!
Fog clears, and there's a whole town here, though most of it is boarded up (oops)
Gift basket contained 2 health potions (1d4+4 healing?)
Went to tavern, everyone was pale inside
Barkeeps name was Arick, b
Met [[Ismark]] the Lesser, (son of Indirovich), invited us to his house/Manor
Went with him...
---------
The Indirovich manor
Has definetly seen better days, mostly boarded up, burn marks
Met [[Ireena]] 
Lots of holy symbols inside (sign of sunrise)
Learned somethings:
 -Castle in distance is were Strahd (the devil) lives
 -Don't invite people places (superstition)
 -Vampyres hate the sun and drink blood
 -[[Strahd]] has kidnapped [[Ireena]] twice
 -Town of Olakey is about 6hours walking march away
 -Visitors like us arrive every year
Decided to help the siblings, (seem like allies) in two regards:
 -bury their father (died like 2 days ago)
 -transport Ireena to Olakey (though they've never been there before)
Also, investigation discovered a bunch of rather pathetic letters from Strahd to Ireena
---------
Burial of the Burgomaster
Went to Father Donovitch's church 
Heard moaning from the basement, decided not to press on the matter (for now)
Buried Donovitch without much incident 
---------
Preparations before leaving:
Can do some minor shopping at the mercantile (Buidrat's?)
Was told not to bother Ms. Marre
Don't be out during the night, wear hoods, follow road
Also, don't forget to meet Mariliva? at the Zarpool? for some foresight.
----------
~Prepare the travel music!~
Todo:
 -retrieve those letters, could serve to help ruin Strahd's reputation at a later time

Speculation:
 -If we are goind to be waylaid while traveling, likely from the back
I'm pretty sure I misspelt all the names, oops

Oh my god I'm sorry. I'm really bad at pronouncing words
It's "Valaki" not "Olakey"
Ibrahim - Tuesday"Tues"Silvereye — 04/23/2022
I think it's just an online thing, but that's good to know
Alexander — 04/24/2022
Oh also an important note! Father Donavich mentioned that if Valaki doesn't work, the Abby in Krez might be a safe place for Ireena
