Party starts in at the [[Winery]]

There is one [[Druids]] left in the secret tunnel. Claims to be the winemaker, but also claims he never delivered wine to [[Krezk]]. Finally, tells us that the Winemakers are in the forest and the druids kicked them out. The [[Druids]] give some of the wine to [[Strahd]]. 

The Party meets the winemaker family and meet [[Silvia]]. [[Silvia]] and her family are ravens and were the ravens outside [[Old bone grinder]] etc. The party was allowed to stay inside the [[Winery]] for the night.

[[Grog]] and [[Tuesday]] have a heart-to-heart about losing [[Gura]] and being sad.

[[Rictavio]] pulls the party into a room and reveals himself as [[Rudolph van Richten]]. 

- [[Rudolph van Richten]] hate the [[Vistani]] because they lead to the death of his son
- [[Rudolph van Richten]] doesnt trust [[Silvia]] and her family

[[Rudolph van Richten]] tells us:

- [[Strahd]] has scrying and teleportation abilities
- [[Strahd]] has reshaped the land to destroyed [[Berez]]
- we need to figure out the limits to [[Strahd]]s vampirism
- Most vampires can't cross running water
- Needs to be invited in
- [[Strahd]] made a culture of inviting people in
- He has a coffin, we need to find it. Probably in [[Castle Ravenloft]]
	- Probably in the crypts
- There is a Tomb in the crypt of [[Valaki]] that tells secrets of [[Strahd]]
- [[Berez]] has connections to his long dead lover Tatiana 
- Right before [[Strahd]] died he made a dark pack with a dark being in [[Amber Temple]], as soon as he tried to marry Tatiana all hell broke loose and killed him, Tatiana, and his brother
