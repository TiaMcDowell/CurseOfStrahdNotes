Notes: I'm taking them this campaign! Session 1: Tavern (Daggerford) Party met up and introductions were made We're all short, save for Ghogmuh. Mysterious man (MM1) came, handed money to barkeep to pay for drinks for the house (seems well know in the tavern, not one of us knows him)) Came to say hi to us, gave us a letter (Kalyan's 1st letter, henceforth reffered to as KL1) KL1: call for help from Kalyan (Burgomaster) in Barovia to come help [[Ireena]], had a castle seal (Seal1) Asked about Barovia, MM1: "Land which my people roam freely) Inquired about travel to Barovia, kitchen boy: beware the mist Travel to Barovia (Cue the travel music!) Next day, party set out to Barovia, went through misty forest that gave off bad vibes (trees appearing dead, etc) Lots of paths leading into Barovia, none leaving Party came upon a massive portculis with iron gates. The gates openend for us, and closed behind us After 1h20 minutes of travel, at 4:20pm, party came across dead commoner corpse and retrieved another letter: Kaylan's 2nd letter (KL2): "Seal off Barovia, Ireena is a vampyre, and this has been going of for 400 years" KL2 was sealed with a B (for Burgomaster? or Barovia?) (Seal2) Party turned back, found gates closed at portculis, returned travelling. After 30? minutes of travel past where the found the body, came across a small settlement Heard cries coming from a house, went to investigate Death House (exterior) Came across a victorian style house that seems decayed and weathered on the outside Two crying children, 10 year old Girl (unknown name), 7 year old Boy (Thorn?) Told us of a monster in basement, Mom and Dad are inside and keep the monster in the basement One brother (Walter) in the Nursery. Children unsure of how long they've been outside. Death house (interior) Heiro: Divine sense: vibes of undeath everywhere. Interior of the building is far more well kept than the outside... why? Party was about to go into the basement

    Things to Investigate: Are there more foot marks going into the house than out, if so, why? How is time working here, the inside of the house is much better than the outside? Relatives of the family of this house, neighbours? Who live here? Where are Mom, Dad, and Walter? Why is there a monster in the basement? Who really wrote those letters?

    Speculation~ Vampyres (and MM1) intercepted KL2 and replaced it with KL1 to draw marks (us) into Barovia - explains different tone of notes, messages and most importantly, differings Seal1 and Seal2 - Does not explain why the handwriting is the same (forgery, suggestion spell?) MM1 works with Vampyre out of devotion (see quote about when he is asked about Barovia

    I should also clarify the divine sense info more, since I'm unhappy with the description I gave. The house and the entryway you were standing all gave off a putrid sense of undeath. You can't tell the location of this stuff when it's behind total cover, but your divine sense is definitely warning you about something
