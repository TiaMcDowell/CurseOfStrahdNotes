Hannah - Ghogmuh — 04/04/2022
- Session started back at Durst Manor “[[Death House]]”
- Learnt, the children are Rosavalda ("Rose") and Thornboldt ("Thorn") and Walter. Gustav and Elisabeth Durst are the parents 
- Walter isn’t included in the family portraits
- The children seem to have disappeared into the mist. Gura left a light stone out front in case they are lost and try to return
- move to upper floor of manor 
- portrait that includes Walter has the mother with a scornful expression 
- This floor is generally dusty and unkept 
- [[Ghogmuh]] found a secret room in the library with a trapped chest with a skeleton, books, spell scrolls, and a deed in it 
-  The deed shows that all will be inherited by Rose and Thorn, leaving nothing to Walter
- The skeleton has a letter grasped in its hands 
- The letter: Same handwriting as letter 1, but signed with the name Strahd. Recall the letters 1 and 2 had different seals and different handwriting but were signed by Kolyan (Maybe someone can double check that. I wrote down two contradictory things regarding the letters and their writings in session 1 and 2). The skeleton letter was hostile towards the Durst family, referencing an affair and a stillborn child
- move to upper floor of manor 
- FIGHT: suit of armour. [[Tuesday]] threw a knife at it scaring the party. [[Heiro]] (?) and [[Tuesday]] threw it down the stairs. We successfully killed it 
- FIGHT: spectre ghost weeping. [[Gura]] was the first to enter the room and targeted by the spectre. it used life drain and brought her to 0HP, dead without death saves. Hearing a spooky voice she chose to “come back for a cost”. Successfully killed the spectre 
- Noticing magic is “off.” [[Ghogmuh]]’s mage hands are skeletal and [[Tuesday]] has spooky dissonante whispers 
- [[Ghogmuh]] looked through a keyhole to a child crying in a crib in the nursery, but when the door was open it was an empty covered crib
- No stairs were found to the basement 
- [[Ghogmuh]] and [[Gura]] found a secret attic staircase
- In the attic, [[Heiro]] (?) shot a poison dart at some mannequins covered in sheets
- In a locked bedroom, children laughter can be heard
- (I forget who, sorry) found a key to the room
- Two child skeletons were on the ground, as well as a miniature doll house replica of the manor that included miniature dolls of the party in the attic. 
- Found stairs to the basement using the dollhouse 
- Rose and Thorn appeared as ghostly apparitions, “have you come to free us?” 
- end of session
…still getting used to my new character so just pretend I didn’t misspell ghogmuh as grogmuh everywhere
ghogmuh obviously is just devastated grog wasn’t there and I’m making up for it with a tribute name
Hannah - Ghogmuh — 04/04/2022
I forgot to add that Gura seems to smell like evil/death according to [[Heiro]], her cat Fleur was wary about returning to her after she was resurrected as well
Alexander — 04/04/2022
10/10 notetaking Hannah
Ibrahim - Tuesday"Tues"Silvereye — 04/04/2022
Comparing to my own notes: [[Heiro]] used a crossbow to shoot the doll and mannequins.
Speculation ~
Pretty sure Gustav (and maybe Elizabeth) abused their children for some darker poweris
Walter is Gustav's illigetimate child
[[Gura]] is turning evil
Hannah - Ghogmuh — 04/04/2022
I forgot about the doll! how could I
Ibrahim - Tuesday"Tues"Silvereye — 04/04/2022
There's something about windmills too, so time for Don Quixote? 
Tia - Gura — 04/04/2022
Who said I was turning evil?
You have no proof of that
I am a kind old woman
Ibrahim - Tuesday"Tues"Silvereye — 04/04/2022
Heiro's divine sense detects some evil influence
Ibrahim - Tuesday"Tues"Silvereye — 04/04/2022
I almost forget, the player question was "Who would your character die for?"
[[Tuesday]]: "No one, I have very particular reasons why I can't let myself die" 
[[Gura]]: "My faith compells me to sacrifice for others, so if I determined it a fair tried, I would die for anyone"
[[Ghogmuh]]: "I'd die foe Gura and Grog, and I'm a hair away for doing the same for Tues and Heiro"
[[Heiro]] (I'm unsure, but I think it went like this): "No one, I'd get us both out alive, to be strong is to endure, death is cowardly"
