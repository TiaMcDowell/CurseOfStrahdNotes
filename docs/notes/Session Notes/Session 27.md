Party starts talking to [[Cyras]] 

[[Silvia]] starts to bully [[Cyras]]

[[Strahd]] said that without the gems there was no wine being made, and he took all three.

The party agrees to have [[Cyras]] show them the way to the dragon skull in exchange for a bottle of wine. He shows us to a room filled with human bone, a bone table with bone chairs. And a Dragon skull. The human bones are all people [[Strahd]] has killed.

[[Daedi]] and [[Silvia]] dimension door out. The rest of the party try to run out. They get attacked my Gargoyles in the entrance hall.

The party gets the skull on the cart and starts making their way to [[Argynvostholt]].

While travelling, the party sees a man in metal armor on the road. It's [[Godfrey]] from [[Order of the Silver dragon]]. [[Heiro]] convinced him to stop fighting us and help us fight [[Strahd]]. He said he would meet us outside [[Castle Ravenloft]]

The party rests in [[Valaki]], taking a long rest and taking shifts watching the skull.
