Character question: 2.  What does your character want?
[[Heiro]]: Heiro wants to find out why he is still here, easy answer. Nobody else in his village is, after all!
[[Gura]]: Wants to go home, but also wants to be happy where she is. Refuses to be sad in [[Borovia(valley)]].
[[Grog]]: excitement after retirement, got board. Grateful to be out of the house with his wife
[[Tuesday]]: Live, get revenge for being tricked into, help [[Borovia(valley)]].
[[Ghogmuh]]: wants friends and acceptance. One day a pet (with more presence than a rat)(wants big dick energy)

[[Ghogmuh]] and [[Gura]] go into the forest and look for [[Blinksy]]. Find his trail and his hat.

[[Tuesday]] and [[Grog]] go to talk to the [[Vastani]] woman on the road named [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir]]. They follow the tracks of [[Ireena]] towards [[Krezk]]. She is the owner of the cart at the [[Lake Baratok]] tower.

[[Gura]] and [[Ghogmuh]] see a half elf with a bunch of skeletons. He's the right hand to [[Strahd]] named [[Rahadin]]. They are chased by skeletons. [[Gura]] is left unconscious, [[Ghogmuh]] grabs the amulet and runs through the forest. Before [[Gura]] falls completely unconscious she sees [[Rahadin]] standing over her, dismissing the skeletons.

[[Gura]] dies, last hearing "I hope you see waterfalls" by [[Ghogmuh]]

[[Ghogmuh]] runs, finds the rest of the party. [[Grog]] tries to go back for her, but [[Grog]] and [[Tuesday]] convince her that she is dead, and there is no saving her. The party decides to look for [[Ireena]] in [[Krezk]]. The party meets the burglemaster.

The party gets to [[Krezk]] and tries to convince the guards to be let in. [[Ireena]] entered [[Krezk]] with [[Vasili von holt]].
