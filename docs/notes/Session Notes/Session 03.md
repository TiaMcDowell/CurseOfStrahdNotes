Session 3 notes

Attic:
Ghost Children want to be free
Based on conversation given:
  children were locked in attic by Mother until they died (a twisted way of murder)
  this happened shortly after I Walter died
  The Maid was Walter's mother (Children: "Walter was in the Maid's belly)

Outside
Took bones and buried them, this caused the children to dissipate
While digging however, Thorn seemed breifly possessed by a spirit telling us about that the
catacombs u

The basement:
Began exploration
Found 4 coffins, one for each of Gustav, Elisabeth, Rosavlad, Thornbolt Durst
However, did not check contents

COMBAT: One sort of wierd snake thing, party won mostly unscathed

COMBAT: Grog triggered a bunch of attacking corpses, killed one, rest ran away from Gura's Turn Undead
Party is currently regrouping and awaiting the return of the attacking corpses 
----------
Things to investigate
- Are the coffins occupied, if so, with what?
- Where is the monster? (down the stairs)
- Not that it matters, but did Elizabeth lock the children to kill them, or did she never have the chance to unlock the door
(my money is on the former)
----------
Speculation:
Not much today

Maybe you should take your skill at religion as an... ...act of God?
