Party wakes up in [[Valaki]]


We arrive in [[Argynvostholt]], we walk in and the knights immediately attack. During the attack, the party uses Enlarge/Reduce to shrink the skull and rush it into the backyard of [[Argynvostholt]]. We drop the skull in a mausoleum and a bright light bathes the land from the tallest tower. 

The light bathes [[Krezk]], [[Valaki]], [[Berez]], [[Winery]]

The party agrees next step is the [[Amber Temple]]

The party stops by [[Krezk]] to buy cold weather gear and rope.

We get a short rest and a level up!

[[Heiro]] and [[Daedi]] really want to go to the [[Abbey]]
