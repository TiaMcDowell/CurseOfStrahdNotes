~~Unknown,~~ told to go there by the [[Order of the Silver Dragon revenant]]

Visited in [[Session 12]]. A ruined mansion with a dragon guarding it, as referred to in the [[Tarroka Card Readings]].  Inside were several undead Order of the Silver dragon members who are very depressed. There was also a fiery dragon who requested the party to bring light back to their compatriots.
