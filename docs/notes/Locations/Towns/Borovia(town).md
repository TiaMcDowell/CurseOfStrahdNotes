The first town we reached upon entering [[Borovia(valley)]]. 

We first encountered [[Death House]], and [[Gura]] died, she heard a voice that offered her another chance, and she took it. Then all animals were afraid of her, and she glowed evil in the detect evil and good spell.

We met [[Ireena]] there, and she asked us for help to escape [[Strahd]] who has been harassing her.
