You\u2019re welcome to browse as you see fit :) If you plan on editing the GitHub, please let me know beforehand, just so I can actually use branches and such I am now using branches, you are welcome to change the GitHub :) If you don\u2019t want to edit the GitHub but want to contribute, just send it to me over discord! (I know, It\u2019s not quite as cool) https://github.com/TiaMcDowell/CurseOfStrahdNotes How do I edit these notes? \u00b6 Good question! Here\u2019s a tutorial on how to get yourself set up to edit these notes, I\u2019ll try to be as foolproof as possible, but if you run into any problems please let your closest tech friend know, and they can help you. Step 1: Signing up and downloading \u00b6 There are a few tools you need in order to get started. Step 1a: \u00b6 Download obsidian: https://obsidian.md/ Step 1b: \u00b6 Create an Account: https://github.com/ Once you create an account message Tia on Discord your username, she will add your account to the GitHub repo. Step 1c: \u00b6 If you run Windows, download: https://gitforwindows.org/ If you run macOS, you are going to need to open a program called terminal . Once that is open, copy the following gibberish and paste it in there. /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\" brew install git echo 'good job ;)' Step 2: Setting up git and cloning \u00b6 Git is god in computer science, and you are going to learn the basics! Step 2a: \u00b6 We\u2019re going to add your email to git. To do this, open Terminal (macOS) or Git Bash (Windows). Copy and paste (and hit enter) the following changing Your name here and your_email@example.com to your name and email, this is the same email you used to create your GitHub account in Step 1. Your name will show up on GitHub, so it doesn\u2019t have to be your full name or even your actual name, just something to identify you. git config --global user.name \"Your name here\" git config --global user.email \"your_email@example.com\" Step 2b: \u00b6 SSH keys! Super important! Follow the below tutorial to create your own SSH keys and add them into GitHub. First, make sure you don\u2019t already have SSH keys on your computer, if you do, you can just use those: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys if you do not have existing keys, follow this tutorial to generate them: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent We use SSH keys instead of passwords when using git, they are way faster and easier, and you only have to set them up once! Step 2c: \u00b6 Now that we have git set up, we can \u201cclone\u201d the files on to your computer. To do this, open Terminal (macOS) or Git Bash (Windows) again and copy and paste the following and hit enter the following command to download the files. cd ~/Documents git clone https://github.com/TiaMcDowell/CurseOfStrahdNotes.git Great! Now you have the files! Next is setting you up to edit them. Step 3: Setting up to edit \u00b6 Once we have the files, how do we edit them while staying up to date with other people who edit them? Step 3a: \u00b6 Open obsidian on your computer, you are then going to open an existing vault. The \u201cVault\u201d is what you downloaded from git. It should be in your Documents folder. Once you open it, you should be able to see all the notes in the docs folder. Step 4: Editing \u00b6 This is VERY important. This is also the part of the tutorial you should come back to from time to time. These are the commands you run BEFORE and AFTER editing the notes for a session. Step 4a: \u00b6 BEFORE editing, run the following commands in your terminal/git bash, changing NAME and NUMBER to your name/username/chosen identifier and session number. Please remember to do this, if you do not your changes may be saved to the wrong place and be annoying to get back. cd ~/Documents/CurseOfStrahdNotes git checkout main git pull git checkout -b NAME-session-NUMBER echo \"you are now ready to make changes :)\" Step 4b: \u00b6 AFTER you are completely done editing the notes for a session, run the following commands, changing NAME and NUMBER to the same thing you changed it to in 4a. If you do not run these commands, your changes will not be saved to GitHub and will not show up on the website cd ~/Documents/CurseOfStrahdNotes git add . git commit -m \"session notes\" git push --set-upstream origin NAME-session-NUMBER echo \"your changes have been saved, and in a few minutes be up on the website.\" If you run into any issues, message your closest tech person :) \u00b6","title":"Notes!"},{"location":"#notes","text":"Welcome to my notes on Curse of Strahd!
